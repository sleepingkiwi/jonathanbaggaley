description: Images from an ongoing AHRC funded practice based PhD which examines the traditional photographic portrait studio and its apparatus as a space for the articulation of identity and desire. Through a number of different strategies the studio becomes interrogated in an attempt to find a visual language adequate to the exploration of its psychic economy and coercive discourse.
