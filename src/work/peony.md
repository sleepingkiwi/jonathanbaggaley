description: "*Peony* is a moving image work lasting 6hrs 42minutes. It consists
  of a single, static and continuous view of a Peony plant in flower, recorded
  onto VHS tape, using a domestic camcorder. The piece is designed to provide a
  meditation on the passing of time in relation to objects and on the act of
  filming itself. Standard VHS is used here as a form of Brechtian device which,
  on account of its relatively low quality, never allows an illusion of reality
  to become convincing or complete. It is intended that, through prolonged
  viewing, the obvious disparities between representation and reality, become
  accepted as a given form of aesthetic abstraction; a thing in itself."
