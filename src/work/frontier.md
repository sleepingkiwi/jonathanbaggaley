projectDate: 2019
description: These images here have been collected from high street photographic
  labs between 2000 and 2018. At the beginning of this period film dominated the
  domestic market, by the end of it, film was virtually redundant as a mass
  medium. What characterised this period overall was the hybrid nature of the
  technology used, combining analogue and digital processes in the production of
  domestic snapshots and passport images. Film became scanned and printed via
  lasers onto traditional light sensitive paper before advances in dry lab
  technology effectively brought an end to the era of light sensitive silver
  halide technology that has characterised the medium since its inception. This
  overlapping of technologies is represented through failures in the process and
  calibration images designed to minimize such anomalies. This work represents
  this unique period picturing a strange disappearing world where subjects
  struggle to be represented through an apparatus that is at once progressive,
  traditional, coercive, alchemic and ultimately magical.
