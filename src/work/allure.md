description: >-
  Allure is a bookwork that attempts (and fails) to present a visual equivalent to the disparate and seemingly random assemblage of cultural, familial and psychological elements that make up just one aspect (desire) of an ultimately indefinable self. The book contains 56 images in total grouped in chapters whose titles include Memory, Books, Family, Camera, Pornography, Machine and Sculpture.
