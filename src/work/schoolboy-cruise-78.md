title: Schoolboy Cruise '78
projectDate: 2007
description: >-
  A visual metaphor for the ego and the id of a 14 year old boy - myself in 1978. The snapshots were taken on a school cruise which is also where the pornography was acquired.  At the time, the pornography seemed more interesting than the historical sights. It was the photographs that were shown on my return home, not the pornography. In this sense these pictures represent what we choose to show, juxtaposed with what we feel we cannot show. They also invite a questioning of how we view photographic images from distinct genres.
